Paws Paradise is all about pampering your pooch! Whether your pooch has sole reign over your house and prefers not to be bothered with any other puppy subjects in his doggie kingdom or you have a pup that just can’t wait to tell all his furry friends about his new squeaky toy, Paws Paradise has packages tailored to your pets’ needs. For pricing information, please see <a href="Prices.html">Prices</a>.

Does Fido like to run and run and run? Or maybe Bruno prefers a slow meander while he sniffs out all the good stuff- you know, taking time to smell the roses or er um hydrants!
Every dog has a different personality and different likes or dislikes, so to make sure your pet gets the most out of their walk, we individually match your dog’s personality with the best-suited dog walker. All our dog walkers are passionate pet lovers with years of experience with different breeds and temperaments as well as comprehensive background checks so you can be sure your pet is in good hands.

*Paws Paradise provides your pet with the best possible care and experience. If you have any special requests, please do not hesitate to ask.
