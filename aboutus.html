    <b>Our Facility</b> <br> <br>
Based just outside of Toronto, Paws Paradise has been offering top quality dog walking and boarding services for over 15 years. Our facility is situated on 6 acres of fenced-in area so your pup has plenty of new places to explore when 
they're not enjoying some down-time in one of our 60 spacious 'doggy condos'. Each condo is specifically designed for maximum comfort for your pooch. This means tons of toys and comfy places to curl up and snooze after a long exciting day! 
And what puppy palace would be complete without its own greenspace? Each condo is outfitted with its own fenced-in outdoor area, which your pooch has access to at all times. 
During the day, your pups are spoiled with field trips, games, and tons of belly rubs and our overnight staff ensure that your pup is treated like canine royalty the whole night through. 
    <br> <br>
