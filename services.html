Going away on vacation or maybe an important business meeting? Why not send your pup on vacation too?! Paws Paradise is all about pampering your pooch. Our goal is to be a home away from home so that when you do need to board your dog, they actually look forward to it! Leaving you to enjoy a guilt free holiday while your pet gets all the spoiling they deserve. <br><br>
All of us get a bit anxious leaving our pet in an unfamiliar place for the first time, so to get rid of some of your worry we have broken down what an average day at Paws Paradise looks like.  Your pup stays in their own private doggy condo, set up like a mini house specifically built for your dog–meaning tons of comfy spots to grab some zzzs and tons of toys to play with. Each doggy condo has a small fenced in yard that your pet has complete access to at all times. Night staff keeps a watchful eye over your pups in their condos to soothe anyone’s bad dreams or homesickness. 
There are two main options for boarding your pet at Paws Paradise, however we do offer specialized programs directly tailored to your pup’s individual needs. For more information please contact us at 555-556-5567. 
For pricing information, please see <a href="Prices.html">Prices</a>.

*Paws Paradise provides your pet with the best possible care and experience. If you have any special requests, please do not hesitate to ask.
